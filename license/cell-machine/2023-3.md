## Definitions

Team means the Cell Machine development team, which includes, but is not limited to, Kaiden Howard (Mystic), Leo Epperson (Snazz), and William Jackson (Kegnh), who develop and publish official Cell Machine content.

Cell Machine refers to the original game made by Sam Hogan, as well as offical content and works made and released by the Team. It also includes the source code and concepts used in the games.

Subticking is the method of evaluating in which order cells perform their respective actions during Cell Machine gameplay. This definition applies as far as it is used in Cell Machine or a Derivative Work.

V3 Encoding is the method of storing and compressing a grid of Cell Machine cells into a string of text used in Cell Machine games to save and share levels. This definition applies as far as this particular encoding and compression scheme is used in Cell Machine or a Derivitive Work.

Derivative Work means any content or work that is primarily based on Cell Machine but not officially released by the Team. This includes any works that feature:
 - the name "Cell Machine";
 - textures or other assets from Cell Machine;
 - the Subticking mechanic;
 - the V3 Encoding scheme;
 - source code (including but not limited to the publicly availible Cell Machine Mystic Mod v3 source code);
 - levels or puzzles from Cell Machine.

Remake means any Derivative Work in the form of a computer game that is substantially different from Cell Machine. It does not include any offical Cell Machine content. For example, any game that:
 - includes additional content or modifies the existing content substantially;
 - includes features that do not exist in any Cell Machine game;
 - is written in a different programming language, game engine, or platform than the base game;
 - does not contain any Cell Machine source code, and is completely made by the Reamake author;
